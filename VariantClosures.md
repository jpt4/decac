Deca represents closure types as a [variant](SumTypes.md) with two cases: a function pointer without an environment and a function pointer taking a pointer to an [existentially quantified](ExistentialTypes.md) (see [Minamide1996](Minamide1996.md)) closure environment. When a function call is performed through a closure, a run-time case dispatch is done to determine what sort of function is being called and to pass it its appropriate environment (or lack thereof). Lambda expressions capture variables by value rather than by reference, so Deca closures function rather like syntactic sugar for C++ functors[Jarvi2001](Jarvi2001.md).  They therefore do not require garbage-collection of stack frames.
